Each color property starts with -color-* prefix. There're global colors , that are defined at the Scene root level and individual controls colors (check the corresponding control reference for the info). What's looked-up color? TL;DR : It's a color variable . As any other CSS property looked-up colors resolved according to CSS specificity rules. If you imagine the following hierarchy: Scene [class = root] Region [class = r1] Region [class = r2] Region [class = r3] We can manipulate the background color of each descending node with the following CSS rules (most specific wins): . root { -color-background : transparent ; } . r1 , . r2 , . r3 { -fx-background-color : - color - background ; } . r2 { -color-background : red ; } /* applied to the r2 and below */ . r2 > . r3 { -color-background : green ;} JavaFX will try to resolve color variable value starting from the most to the least specific rule, which is always the root of the Scene hierarchy. Result: r1 - transparent r2 - red r3 - green All stylesheets are written in SASS and compiled to CSS by using a very handy sass-cli-maven-plugin . You don't have to learn SASS, though it's a very simple language if you're already familiar with CSS. Tip Theme is not limited by colors. If you only want to change global colors, all you need is to override default looked-up color variables. The easiest way is to utilize pseudo-class, so you can always return to the default color scheme. . root : custom-theme { -color-bg-default : #123456 ; /* ... and so on */ } // declare pseudo-class private static PseudoClass CUSTOM_THEME = PseudoClass . getPseudoClass ( \"custom-theme\" ); // then apply it to the root node getScene (). getRoot (). pseudoClassStateChanged ( CUSTOM_THEME , true ); Compilation You can find ready to use custom theme template in the atlantafx-sample-theme repository. Clone the sample repository. git clone https://github.com/mkpaz/atlantafx-sample-theme Compile it. cd atlantafx-sample-theme mvn compile [ -Pwatch ] # (optionally) watch for changes Grab resulting CSS from dist/ directory and connect it to your application. Application . setUserAgentStylesheet ( /* path to the CSS file */ ); Modification Each SCSS file in the source directory is nothing but a separate SASS module that can be imported by other files. You can find a bunch of SASS variables at the top of a file. If variable is marked as !default , it can be changed during theme compilation. In fact, any AtlantaFX theme can be used as an example. They all share the common sources and use SASS variable modification to compile the different stylesheets. Tip If you want to customize a style property that is not exposed as SASS variable, don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR . Warning Note that SASS is only loading any module (file) just once, so customization order does matter . E.g. if A module imports B and B imports C then we have to override C variables first, then B, then A. Otherwise, there will be an exception that we are attempting to change a variable in a module that has been already loaded. Example: // Color customization. @for ward \"relative/path/to/settings/color-vars\" with ( // ... ); // Shared property customization. @for ward \"relative/path/to/settings/config\" with ( // ... ); // This should precede controls customization, as it guarantees // that .root styles precede components styles. @use \"general\" ; // Individual component property customization. // Use \"as name-*\" to avoid conflicts if two or more SASS modules // contain variables with the same name. @for ward \"relative/path/to/components/split-pane\" as split-pane- * with ( // ... ); Color Contrast If you want to develop a good theme, there are some accessibility rules. Color contrast between text and its background must meet required WCAG standards . The contrast requirements are: 4.5:1 for normal text 3:1 for large text (>24px) 3:1 for UI elements and graphics No contrast requirement for decorative and disabled elements You can check and modify color contrast directly in the Sampler app. Click on any block to run contrast checker and get more detailed info. Testing You can use Sampler app to test and develop your custom theme. Including hot reload, of course. Start Sampler app in development mode (check build instructions for more info). If you downloaded packaged Sampler app, you can do that by setting ATLANTAFX_MODE=dev env variable.

You can preview all of them in the Sampler app on Theme page. AtlantaFX is based on GitHub Primer color system. You can check GitHub Primer interface guidelines for more detailed instructions. There are functional color variables and color scale variables. Functional Colors Foreground Colors Color Usage -color-fg-default Primary color for text and icons. It should be used for body content, titles and labels. -color-fg-muted For content that is secondary or that provides additional context but is not critical to understanding the flow of an interface. -color-fg-subtle For placeholders or decorative foregrounds. -color-fg-emphasis The text color designed to combine with *-emphasis backgrounds for optimal contrast. Background Colors Color Usage -color-bg-default Primary background color. -color-bg-overlay Background color for popup controls such as popovers and tooltips. -color-bg-subtle Provides visual rest and contrast against the default background. -color-bg-inset For a focal point, such as in conversations or activity feeds. Border Colors Color Usage -color-border-default Default color to create bounds around content. -color-border-muted For dividers to emphasize the separation between items, columns or sections. -color-border-subtle Faint border color. -color-shadow-default Color for creating shadow effects around controls. Accent Colors The below colors are all accent colors. Use them according to their role. The variable names are self-explaining. Neutral colors. Use to highlight content without any added meaning. -color-neutral-emphasis-plus -color-neutral-emphasis -color-neutral-muted -color-neutral-subtle Accent (or primary/brand) color.

Use to express the completion or positive outcome of a task. -color-success-fg -color-success-emphasis -color-success-muted -color-success-subtle Attention colors.

They can have its own unique value, e.g. to add opacity. Chart Colors Chart colors are named as -color-chart-[1-8] and are used, well, for charts. The reason they are defined as global variables is to allow them to be used in controls that do not have .chart class, e.g. for drawing or diagrams. Color Scale Generally, scale variables only supposed to be used by theme devs as a replacement of dynamic brightness calculation functions. Avoid referencing them directly when building UI that needs to adapt to different color themes. Instead, use the functional variables listed above. All legitimate functional color combinations are guaranteed to look good in all color themes, because they need to maintain a certain amount of contrast. In rare cases, you may need to use scale variables to define custom functional variables in your application. Each color scale consists of 10 shades from 0 to 9. -color-dark -color-light -color-base-[0-9] -color-accent-[0-9] -color-success-[0-9] -color-warning-[0-9] -color-danger-[0-9]","title":"Global Colors"},{"location":"reference/global-colors/#global-colors","text":"Global variables are defined at the Scene root level.
