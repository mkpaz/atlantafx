Global variables are defined at the Scene root level. You can preview all of them in the Sampler app.

AtlantaFX is based on GitHub Primer color system. You can check [GitHub Primer interface guidelines](https://primer.style/design/foundations/color) for more detailed instructions. There are functional color variables and color scale variables.

## Functional colors

Foreground colors.

| Color                | Usage                                                                                                                            |

The below colors are all accent colors. Use them according to their role. The variable names are self-explaining.

* `-color-neutral-subtle`

Accent (or primary) color. Use to draw attention to the particular area or component.

## Scale variables

Generally, scale variables only supposed to be used by theme devs as replacement of dynamic brightness calculation functions. Avoid referencing them directly when building UI that needs to adapt to different color themes. Instead, use the functional variables listed above. All legitimate functional color combinations are guaranteed to look good in all color themes, because they need to maintain a certain amount of contrast. If you're using scale variable as a part of that combination it may break in another theme. In rare cases, you may need to use scale variables to define custom functional variables in your application.

Each color scale consists of 10 shades from 0 to 9.

* `-color-dark`
* `-color-light`
* `-color-base-[0-9]`
* `-color-accent-[0-9]`
* `-color-success-[0-9]`
* `-color-warning-[0-9]`
* `-color-danger-[0-9]`
